# History and Origin's
Though the origins of the game are unknown, a variant is mentioned in a book of children's games assembled by Alice Gomme in 1894 called Birds,
Beasts, and Fishes. This version lacks the image of a hanged man, instead relying on keeping score as to the number of attempts it took each player 
to fill in the blanks.

A version which incorporated hanging imagery was described in a 1902 Philadelphia Inquirer article, which stated that it was popular at "White Cap" parties
hosted by "Vigilance Committees" where guests would wear "white peaked caps with masks".

# Rules and Regulations
The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes representing each letter of the word. Rules may permit or forbid proper nouns, such as names, places, 
brands, or slang. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs in the word, the other player writes it in all its correct positions. If the 
suggested letter does not occur in the word, the other player draws one element of a hanged stick figure as a tally mark.

The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word.[citation needed] If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser
wins. Otherwise, the other player may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the guesser makes enough
incorrect guesses to allow the other player to complete the diagram, the guesser loses. However, the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that
appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.[citation needed]
